An end-to-end Deep Learning solution to identify **38 different plant diseases** across 14 species. This project features a high-accuracy model optimized for **offline mobile deployment**.

## 🚀 The Solution
Agriculture faces massive losses due to undetected diseases. This project provides a **mobile-ready** model that allows farmers to diagnose plant health instantly, even without an internet connection.

### **Key Technical Stats:**
* **Architecture:** EfficientNetV2-S (Transfer Learning)
* **Optimization:** TFLite (Float16 Quantization)
* **Model Size:** ~30 MB (Optimized for Android/iOS)
* **Inference Speed:** <100ms on most modern smartphones

## 📊 Performance Showcase
Our model was trained on the PlantVillage dataset using **Focal Loss** to handle class imbalance, resulting in exceptional precision across all 38 categories.

### **Real-World Test Results**

## 🛠️ How to Deploy on Android
To use the included `.tflite` model in your app:

1.  **Add the model:** Place `plant_care_offline.tflite` and `labels.txt` in your Android Studio `assets` folder.
2.  **Add Dependency:** Add `implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.14.0'` to your `build.gradle`.
3.  **Initialize:** Load the model using the TFLite Interpreter.
